                            <p>I refer to myself as a mermaid because I want nothing more than to be in the ocean.</p>
                            <p>I tried to do Marine Biology, but after two years of taking science classes and not being able to pass Chem I, I decided it was best to try it from a different angle.</p>
                            <p>One of these days, I hope to work for The Nature Conservancy in Austalia to help research and rebuild the reefs.</p>
