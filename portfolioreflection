This semester has been brutal. Graduation has been looming over me like most of the uncertain clouds loom over Corpus Christi. However, I
can honestly say that this class has been one of the scariest. I have learned so many new things about web writing in such a small amount
of time that I'm not even sure I comprehended everything. I do know that I at least learned some of the basics of online writing, I was
exposed to the realm of coding, and I created things on several different sites that I didn't think I had the courage to create. Ultimately,
this class taught me that if I put my mind to something, the worst that can happen is that I learn something I didn't know before.

I was told that the things I would learn in this course are how to:
-Apply the fundamentals of user experience and accessibility to web site design
-Learn how literacy, credibility, copyright, and technology affect web development, and
-Design and/or redesign web projects for audiences using basic software tools, templates, and languages such as HTML and CSS

The things I learned in this class were:
-How to effectively write something in a web setting
-How to communicate with my audience on a website
-How to code in HTML and CSS by learning the basics of both languages
-What copyright is and the loopholes within it
-How to create websites (like WordPress)

The development of this portfolio has been slow going. While tackling other tasks, this portfolio lay in waiting for me to complete 
everything. I have changed it drastically from my first portfolio check. I think now it better reflects me as a person and the work I
have done this semester in a more honest light. What I take away most from this class is that the audience is who should be kept in 
mind when creating a website. The audience is the deciding factor on the success of the website and the traffic it receives. Writing 
for the web is a completely selfless act because it needs to promote the conversation with the visitors. Only then will it be 
successful enough to stay thriving.
