Pertaining to arguments of copyright laws in the public domain, I am torn with the the rules of copyright law. In the Public Domain and 
Orphan Works section of what we read, it is argued that "Copyright owners should be more realistic about the debt they owe to others: no 
author creates out of thin air." However, because of the instated laws and protection of people's works, I understand why people would say 
the artwork was stolen since he didn't give proper credit. While giving proper citations is annoying (as we all know since most of us write
papers on the reg), giving a quick shout-out to where the artwork was found or simply giving credit to the creator, is not.

Pertaining to fair use, if artwork wasn't meant to be seen, why release it in a public forum? In the Fair Use section we read, it is said 
"Textbooks are created for an educational audience. When we are the intended audience for materials, or when we use a work in the same way 
that the author intended it to be used when she created it, we are not 'repurposing' the work for a new audience." The same can be said for
artwork. If it is put on a public forum, I would assume the reason for that is so it can be seen. Preston Jacobs used the artwork in the 
way it was intended to be used.

I don't think Mr. Jacobs had malicious intent when he used the artwork for his videos, however, his response to those who suggested he 
should give due credit was disrespectful. It would have been easier to apologize and give credit than try to argue his way out of not 
giving credit. I don't think it matters that the creators of the artwork would only receive four or five cents, they are still entitled to 
their money and credit for their work. What I believe to be wrong about this situation is that Mr. Jacobs didn't give credit after he was 
asked to. If he still decided not to give credit, then he should have just taken the pictures down.
